## Origin of this template

Matheus Schossler adapted this template in February 2023 based on Liang-Bo Wang GitHub repo [https://github.com/ccwang002/wustl-latex-dissertation-template/]. Liang-Bo Wang's version (2021) is based on Kyle J. Harms (`@harmsk`)'s GitHub repo [harmsk/wustl-latex-dissertation-template].

These are the adaptations:

- Removed emoji package: as of this date emaji.sty is not included in apt tex-live installation (may concern Linux users).
- Removed microtype option "disable=false"
- Removed biblatex package
- Added babel package and \bibliographystyle{ieeetr}
